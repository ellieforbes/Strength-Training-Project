        Strength training provides numerous health benefits, such as a lower
        risk of heart disease and diabetes, stronger bones, better brain health
        and mood, and improved self-esteem.
        <br />
        Fortunately, strength training isn’t just lifting weights at the gym.
        You can get in a great strength-training workout using your body weight,
        resistance bands, free weights, or even items around your house.
        <br />
        Whether you’re new or experienced, strength training is for everyone.
